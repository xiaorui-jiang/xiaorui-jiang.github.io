# ðŸ‘€ About Me

Hi, I'm Xiaorui Jiang, a third-year master's student at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).

My research interest includes MLLM, Multi-view Learning, Representation Learning, and Federated Learning. 

[//]: # (I am currently seeking a PhD position and I hope to continue my research in the areas mentioned above.)
Specifically, my research interests focus on cross-modal information representation and fusion, with emphasis on the following aspects:

1. **Multimodal Information Fusion**: Investigating the representation and fusion of multimodal data in unsupervised environments, with a focus on methods such as federated learning and multi-view learning, aiming to achieve efficient information fusion without relying on labeled data.

2. **Cross-modal Inference Performance Enhancement**: Concentrating on improving the inference performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), particularly focusing on strategies that do not require additional training, striving to optimize their reasoning ability and generalization.

4. **Applications of MLLMs**: Starting in November 2025, I will be working as a research assistant at PolyU, where I will be dedicated to fine-tuning and optimizing multimodal large models for specific domains, driving the development and application of these models in practical scenarios.
