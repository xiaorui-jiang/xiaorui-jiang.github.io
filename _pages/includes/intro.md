I’m a first year master student majoring in Cyberspace Security at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

Currently, I was advised by Prof. Manqing WU (吴曼青院士) and Prof. Yong Liao (廖勇教授) of [RCDC](https://dspace.ustc.edu.cn/) Lab from School of Cyber Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China.

Prior to USTC, I received the B.S.(ranked top 1 out of 49 students) from HeFei University of Technology (HFUT) in 2023.

My research interest includes Multi-view Learning, Federated Learning and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC).
