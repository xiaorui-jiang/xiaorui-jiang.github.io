# ðŸ‘€ About Me

Hi, I'm Xiaorui Jiang, a third-year master's student at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).

My research interest includes MLLM, Multi-view Learning, Representation Learning, and Federated Learning. 

[//]: # (I am currently seeking a PhD position and I hope to continue my research in the areas mentioned above.)
Specifically, my research interests focus on cross-modal information representation and fusion, with emphasis on the following aspects:

1. <b>Multimodal Information Fusion</b>: Investigating the representation and fusion of multimodal data in unsupervised environments,  <p> with a focus on methods such as federated learning and multi-view learning, aiming to achieve  efficient information fusion without </p> relying on labeled data.
2. <b>Cross-modal Inference Performance Enhancement</b>: Concentrating on improving the inference performance of MLLMs, particularly <p>focusing on strategies that do not require additional training, striving to optimize their reasoning ability and generalization.</p>
3. <b>Applications of MLLMs</b>: Starting in Nov. 2025, I will be working as a research assistant at PolyU, where I will  be dedicated  to fine- <p>tuning and optimizing multimodal large models for specific domains, driving the development  and application of these models in </p>practical scenarios.
