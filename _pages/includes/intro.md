# ðŸ‘€ About Me

Hi, I'm Xiaorui Jiang, a third-year master's student at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).


[//]: # (I am currently seeking a PhD position and I hope to continue my research in the areas mentioned above.)
My research interests focus on cross-modal information representation and fusion, with emphasis on the following aspects:

1. <b>Multimodal Information Fusion</b>: Investigating the representation and fusion of multimodal data in unsupervised environments, <br> with a focus on methods such as FL and MVL, aiming to achieve efficient information fusion without relying on labeled data.

2. <b>Multimodal Large Language Models</b>: Concentrating on improving the inference performance of MLLMs,   particularly focusing <br>on strategies that do not require additional training, striving to optimize their reasoning ability and generalization.

3. <b>Applications of MLLMs</b>: Starting in Nov. 2025, I will be working as a RA at PolyU, where I will be dedicated to  fine-tuning  <br> and optimizing MLLMs for specific domains, driving the development and application of these models in practical scenarios.

Currently, my papers under review or in progress include:
**(a)** Unsupervised federated multi-view data representation; <br>
**(b)** Learning dynamics in multi-view data representation;
**(c)** Research on attention mechanisms in MLLMs and training-free <br> strategies for performance enhancement;
**(d)** Training-free token compression methods for MLLMs.
